# RPG Maker MV Plugins

This is a collection of RPG Maker MV Plugins to add various features to your
game. All of the plugins are free for commercial and non-commercial use,
[licensed under the MIT License](./LICENSE). You do not need to give any sort of
credit to use these plugins in your game.

The following plugins are available in this repo:

## [Clear Map Photos](Kru_ClearMapPhotos.js)
Automatically clears all previously loaded photos whenever a map is loaded. This
makes it easier to have parallax photos on your maps as they'll automatically be cleaned up for you.

## [Airship Events](Kru_AirshipEvents.js)
By default, RPG Maker MV doesn't allow airships to interact with events.
This plugin removes that limitation, allowing airships to land in towns, etc.

## [Vehicle Insides](Kru_VehicleInsides.js)
This plugin allows you to easily create maps for the insides of vehicles, like
the Big Whale in Final Fantasy IV or the airships in Final Fantasy VI. The
player will automatically be transported to the map upon entering the vehicle.

## [Multi-tile Events](Kru_MultitileEvents.js)
This plugin allows for events that are bigger than one tiles, by expanding the
collision box via notes. This works nicely for larger sprites (like giant
monsters) that can still wander around like normal events.
